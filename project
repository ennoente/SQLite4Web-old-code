##SQLite4Web

#### Current stable version
1.0

#### Currently developing on version
1.1

#### Versioning
##### Version 1.0
- Upload an SQLite file to the server which reads the file and sends back JSON -> table
  is built from response
- Table shows the data (see table style guide). The individual cells can be accessed and
  manipulated client-side, but are not sent to the server (kind of unnecessary feature, tbh).

##### Version 1.1
- The changes from manipulated cells are sent to the server which changes the db file accordingly.
- Download db file from server

#### General styles
The web app shall be responsive to the width and height of the browser.

#### Button styles
Buttons shall have a width/height ratio of 4.
